# 3CardPoker-Server-and-Client-

This "Networked 3 Card Poker" project involves implementing a networked version of the casino game 3 Card Poker using Java Sockets. Players connect as clients to a server, running separate threads for gameplay and network operations. The server manages game logic, client interactions, and data such as bets and outcomes, while the clients feature an intuitive JavaFX GUI for gameplay.
